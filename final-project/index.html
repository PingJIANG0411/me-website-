            <p>My name is Tyshe. Currently a sophomore at NYU Stern study both Finance and Data Science. I was born in Shanghai China, but moved to the US for my college education. I first got interested in finance when I joined the Smart Woman Securities club in university. Here, I was able to learn more about banking and had the chance to do weekly stock pitches and market updates. I also took on several internships in finance such as Wealth Management, Investment Banking, and Equity Research, from there I realized that I really want to pursue market in the long term because of the steep learning curve and growth opportunities in the industry. In my free time, I love to practice and perform Chinese folk dancing.</p>
